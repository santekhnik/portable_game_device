### 1. Goal of the Game

The player controls a paddle to bounce the ball and score as many points as possible.  
A point is awarded when the ball bounces off the player's paddle.

### 2. Equipment

The game is displayed on a screen connected to an STM system.  
The paddle is controlled using the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard.  
The ball moves automatically.

### 3. Controls

**Player 1:**  
- Left arrow: Moves the paddle to the left.  
- Right arrow: Moves the paddle to the right.  

The ball starts at the center of the field.  
It moves at an angle and changes direction when colliding with the paddle or the walls (left and right).  
If the ball passes beyond the paddle, the game restarts with a pause, and the ball is reset to the center. The game resumes only when the player moves the paddle.

### 4. Paddle Movement

The paddle can move only horizontally within the boundaries of the playing field, constrained to the **x-axis**, while the **y-axis** remains static.  
If a key is held down, the paddle continues moving in the corresponding direction.

### 5. Scoring

The game continues indefinitely until the player misses the ball.  
Points are awarded for each successful bounce of the ball off the paddle, with one bounce equaling 1 point.

### 6. Collisions

The ball changes direction upon collision:  
- **With the paddle**: It bounces off at an angle depending on the point of contact.  
- **With the left or right walls**: It changes both vertical and horizontal trajectories.
